# SOCIAL MEDIA AND MISLEADING INFORMATION IN A DEMOCRACY: A MECHANISM DESIGN APPROACH
The paper addresses the rising concern of misinformation in the digital age, particularly on social media platforms, which prioritize user engagement and often spread conspiracy theories. This trend threatens the trust in democratic systems by distorting common political knowledge. Social media users are highly susceptible to misinformation, making these platforms effective tools for political manipulation, as observed during events like the 2016 U.S. elections and Brexit.
<br>
 To counter this, the paper proposes a game-theoretic framework where the government incentivizes social media platforms to filter misinformation. The government benefits from increased trust in democratic processes, while platforms prioritize engagement and ad revenue, often resisting filtering efforts. 
 <br>
Using mechanism design, a concept from economics, the authors construct a strategic model where both the government and platforms act as rational agents. The proposed mechanism ensures feasibility, budget balance, individual rationality, and strong implementability. It leads to a Pareto-
efficient outcome through a generalized Nash equilibrium

The paper concludes by stating the broader applications of mechanism design and the significance of the proposed solution. Additionally, it touches on the use of machine learning and statistical analysis for personality assessment and opinion mining, highlighting user behavior on social media and its psychological impact.

<b>Motivation</b>
<br>
In the digital era, social media has transformed how individuals consume news, form opinions, and engage in democratic processes. However, the same platforms that empower connectivity and expression have also become breeding grounds for the rapid dissemination of misinformation. Algorithms optimized for engagement tend to prioritize emotionally charged and sensational content, often at the expense of truth and accuracy. This creates a fertile environment for the spread of conspiracy theories, biased narratives, and outright falsehoods.
<br>
The consequences of this trend are far-reaching. Misinformation undermines public trust in institutions, distorts political discourse, and can lead to significant real-world consequences, such as
influencing election outcomes or inciting social unrest. Events such as the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election and the Brexit referendum are stark examples where digital misinformation played a potentially pivotal role in shaping public opinion.
<br>
Despite growing awareness of the issue, social media companies have limited incentives to curb the spread of false information. Their revenue models, driven by user engagement and ad impressions, often conflict with the societal need for accurate and reliable information. Government regulation alone may not suffice, as it can be seen as infringing on free speech or may not be agile enough to keep pace with technological evolution.
<br>
This project is motivated by the need for a structured, incentive-aligned solution that goes beyond reactive measures. By leveraging principles from game theory and mechanism design, we aim to explore how rational, self-interested entities—governments and platforms—can be guided toward cooperation in combating misinformation, thereby safeguarding democratic integrity.
<br>
<b>Objective</b>
<br>
The primary objective of this project is to design a theoretical and implementable framework that aligns the interests of governments and social media platforms in reducing the spread of misinformation. Using mechanism design, a branch of game theory that focuses on designing systems or rules that lead to desired outcomes even when participants act in their own self-interest, the project aims to:
<br>
Model the Strategic Interaction <br>
Design an Incentive-Compatible Mechanism <br>
Achieve Pareto Efficiency <br>
Generalize the Model for Broader Applicability <br>
Evaluate Psychological and Social Impact
